🔐 Sample Passwords Created and Tested

Password	Strength Score	Feedback Summary
password123	18%	Too common, no symbols or uppercase letters
5uM@N#P@uL_786	90%	Very strong, high complexity and good length
ilovecoding	25%	Too simple, only lowercase letters
L#arnT0Hack!	85%	Strong passphrase-style password with good variation

📋 Tips Learned from Evaluation Tools
	1.	Use of Character Variety
Combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols improves strength.
	2.	Length Matters
Passwords over 12 characters are significantly harder to crack.
	3.	Avoid Common Words
Words like “password”, “123456”, or names can be guessed easily.
	4.	Avoid Patterns
Repeated characters or keyboard sequences like “qwerty” reduce strength.
	5.	Use Passphrases
A phrase like MyD0gIs#Gr8! is both memorable and secure.
